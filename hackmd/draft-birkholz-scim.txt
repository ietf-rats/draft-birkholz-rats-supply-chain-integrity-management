1.  Introduction

   Introduction

2.  Terminology

   Actors:  Agent - individual or organization.

      Software Agent - software acting on behalf of an Agent.

   Roles:  Issuing Authority - Agent that issues Signed Evidence, e.g.
      Microsoft.

      Evidence Generator - Software Agent that generates unsigned
      Evidence, e.g.  Office build system.

      Evidence Signer - Software Agent that accepts unsigned Evidence
      and signs, e.g.  Microsoft signing service.

      Ledger Authority - Agent that governs an evidence registry, e.g.
      'Microsoft', 'Global Supply Chain Consortium'.

      Receipt Requestor - Software Agent that submits signed evidence to
      a Registry.

      Ledger Service - Software Agent that accepts and logs Signed
      Evidence.

      Evidence Store - Software Agent that supports query of Registered
      Evidence.

   Messages:  Evidence - unsigned Evidence.

      Signed Evidence - evidence evidence wrapped with a header and
      signed.

      Receipt Request - request to enter evidence in Registry.

      Receipt - receipt issued by Registry verify signed evidence is
      registered.

      Registered Evidence - (same as Receipt?)

   Questions: * How do we handle query and receipt of registered
   evidence in the model? * How do we handle policy and verification in
   the model?

   Ledger:  tbd

2.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
